# Deep Neural Network Based Yield Phenotyping Framework: Fruit Grading and Classification

 🌟 Project Overview:
Instigates an AI-based Yield Phenotyping Framework for fruit classification and grading.

🍎 Fruit Characteristics:
Focuses on homogeneity in color, shape, and size.
Addresses challenges in grading and segmentation due to these uniform qualities.

🎯 Primary Objective:
Establishes a real-time, non-destructive system for automating fruit segmentation, grading, and classification.

📊 Datasets and Analysis:
Utilizes two different datasets.
Conducts a detailed analysis of deep learning models: AlexNet and ResNet.

🍇 Fruit Diversity:
Incorporates various fruit types into the prototype.
Records videos of each fruit and sends them to a local server.

🤖 Deep Learning Models:
Predict fruit grades.
Conveyor belt system sorts fruits into baskets based on their grade.

🖼️ Image Preprocessing:
Applies techniques to precisely isolate fruits in each image.

📈 Evaluation Metrics:
Considers accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score to evaluate models.

🚀 Model Performance:
ResNet architecture achieves peak accuracy, precision, and recall of 99%.

📑 Research Presentation:
Details the prototype’s architecture, methodologies, and experimental results.
Provides an automated solution to an existing challenge in Agri-field management.
